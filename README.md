# password-generator

## Description

This password generator was given to us so we could practice writing JavaScript code. We applied tools taught to us over the past week, such as variables, functions, arrays, prompts, loops, strings, booleans, and if/else statements. The password generator prompts the user to select how many characters it would like to use - between 8-128. The prompt will loop until the user selects an acceptable character count. It then has a series of booleans that ask the user if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters. The prompts will loop until the user selects at least one of the aforementioned choices. Once completed, the password generator will generate a password based on the constrains designated by the user.
